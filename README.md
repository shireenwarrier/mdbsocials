# mdbsocials
MDB Socials is an app where the user can either sign up or log in to the app with an email and password, and is then taken to their feed. The feed has events that users have posted, and you can see who are going and all the information of the event by clicking on the individual cell. You can also create and post an event from the main feed view. The app uses Firebase to store User and Event information.
